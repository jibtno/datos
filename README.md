- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- NextAuth for authentication

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the development server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Build for production**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Project Structure
